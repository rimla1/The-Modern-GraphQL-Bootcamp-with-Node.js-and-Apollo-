By nature all GraphQL APIs are self documented

There are three major operations that we can perform on any GraphQL API:
    query (allows us to fetch data)
    mutations (allows us to change data)
    subscription (watch data for changes great for real time app)


type: query
field: hello

query{
    hello
}

Nested query
query{
    posts{
        title
    }
}

From posts get each title's post
